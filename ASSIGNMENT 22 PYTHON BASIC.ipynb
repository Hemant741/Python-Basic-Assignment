In Python 3, the nonlocal keyword is used to indicate that the variable being defined is a non-local variable, which means that it is not a local variable in the current function, but rather it is defined in the enclosing function. In this code, the variable X is defined in the enclosing function, func(), and the nested() function modifies it using the nonlocal keyword. Therefore, when func() is called, nested() modifies X to 'Spam', and when the print statement in func() is executed, it prints the value of X, which is 'Spam'."
