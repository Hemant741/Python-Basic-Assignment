    "## 1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-The feature in Python responsible for generating 'Regex' objects is the 're' module. This module provides support for regular expressions (regex) in Python and contains functions for working with regex patterns and creating 'Regex' objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a 'Regex' object, you can use the 'compile()' function of the 're' module, which takes a regex pattern as a string argument and returns a compiled 'Regex' object that can be used to match strings against the pattern. "

    "## 2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-Raw strings are often used in Python regex patterns to avoid escaping special characters. In Python, backslashes () are used to escape characters in strings. For example, if you want to include a double quote (\") character in a string, you would need to escape it like this:\n",
    "\n",

    "Ans:-The search() method of a Regex object in Python returns a match object if a match is found in the string being searched, or None if no match is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "The match object contains information about the match, such as the starting and ending positions of the match in the string, the matched substring, and any groups that were matched. You can use methods and attributes of the match object to access this information."

    "Ans:-To get the actual strings that match the pattern from a 'Match' object in Python, you can use the 'group()' method or one of its variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'group()' method returns the entire matched substring, or a specific group of the match if the pattern contains one or more groups. If the match object was created using a regex pattern that contains no groups, group(0) will return the same result as 'group()'."

    "\n",
    "Ans:-The regex r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)' defines two groups using parentheses. Group 1 is defined as (\\d\\d\\d) and matches three consecutive digits, and group 2 is defined as (\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d) and matches a string of six digits separated by a hyphen.\n",

    "Group 2 in the match object covers the second group of the regex, which is '(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)'. This group matches a string of six digits separated by a hyphen, so group 2 in the match object will contain a string of six digits separated by a hyphen.\n"

    "\n",
    "Ans:-In regular expressions syntax, parentheses and intervals have special meanings and are used for grouping and specifying repetitions, respectively. To match literal parentheses and periods in a regular expression pattern, you need to escape them using a backslash '\\'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use the backslash character '\\' to escape special characters in a regular expression pattern. For example, to match a literal left parenthesis '(' and right parenthesis ')', you can escape them like this: '\\(' and '\\)'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, to match a literal period '.' you can escape it like this: '\\.'. This tells the regular expression engine to treat the period as a literal character, rather than as a wildcard character that matches any character."
