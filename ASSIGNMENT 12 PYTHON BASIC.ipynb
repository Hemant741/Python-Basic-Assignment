    "## 1. In what modes should the PdfFileReader() and PdfFileWriter() File objects will be opened?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-The 'PdfFileReader()' and 'PdfFileWriter()' classes in the PyPDF2 module are used to read and write PDF files, respectively. When creating instances of these classes, the file objects passed as arguments should be opened in different modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.PdfFileReader(): When creating a PdfFileReader object, the file should be opened in binary mode ('rb') using the built-in open() function. This is because PDF files are binary files and must be read in binary mode. Example code to open a PDF file in binary mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "from PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader\n",
    "\n",
    "with open('example.pdf', 'rb') as pdf_file:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pdf_reader = PdfFileReader(pdf_file)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.PdfFileWriter(): When creating a PdfFileWriter object, the file should be opened in binary mode ('wb') using the built-in open() function. This is because PyPDF2 writes PDF files in binary mode. Example code to create a new PDF file in binary mode:\n",

    "## 2. From a PdfFileReader object, how do you get a Page object for page 5?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-To get a Page object for a specific page in a PDF file using PdfFileReader, you can use the getPage() method, which takes a zero-based index of the page you want to retrieve. To get a Page object for page 5 of a PDF file, you would call getPage(4) (remember, page indexes are zero-based):\n",

    "## 5. What methods do you use to rotate a page?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-In PyPDF2, you can use the rotateClockwise() and rotateCounterClockwise() methods of the PageObject class to rotate a page clockwise or counterclockwise, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rotateClockwise() method rotates a page 90 degrees clockwise, while the rotateCounterClockwise() method rotates a page 90 degrees counterclockwise. These methods return a new PageObject that represents the rotated page.\n",
