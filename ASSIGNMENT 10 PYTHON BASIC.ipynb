    "## 1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree() are two functions provided by the shutil module in Python for copying files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "shutil.copy(src, dst, *, follow_symlinks=True):\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is used to copy a file from the source location src to the destination location dst. If src is a symbolic link, the actual file referred to by the link is copied (unless follow_symlinks is set to False). If dst specifies a directory, the file is copied into that directory with the same name. If dst specifies a file name, the file is copied with that name.\n",
    "\n",
    "shutil.copytree(src, dst, symlinks=False, ignore=None, copy_function=copy2, ignore_dangling_symlinks=False, dirs_exist_ok=False):\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is used to recursively copy a directory and its contents from the source location src to the destination location dst. If dst already exists, an error is raised unless dirs_exist_ok is set to True. If symlinks is set to True, symbolic links are copied as links, rather than the files or directories they refer to. The ignore parameter can be used to specify a callable that determines which files or directories to ignore during the copy process. The copy_function parameter can be used to specify a different function to use for copying files, instead of the default shutil.copy2()."

    "\n",
    "Ans:-The send2trash and shutil modules provide functions for deleting files and directories in Python, but they differ in their approach to deletion:\n",
    "\n",
    "send2trash module: This module provides a cross-platform send-to-trash function that sends files or directories to the system trash or recycle bin rather than permanently deleting them. The send2trash.send2trash() function takes a file or directory path as an argument and moves it to the trash or recycle bin of the user's operating system.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:-The ZipFile class in Python's zipfile module is used to create, read, write, and extract ZIP files. To open a ZIP file using the ZipFile class, you can use the ZipFile() constructor method, which is equivalent to the open() method for file objects.\n",
