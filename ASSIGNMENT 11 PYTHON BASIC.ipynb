    "## 8.Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-Using logging messages is better than using print() to display the same message for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Flexibility: The logging module provides a lot more flexibility and configurability than print(). You can set different logging levels, output messages to different destinations (e.g. files, console), and format the messages in different ways. This makes it easier to customize the logging output to suit your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Severity levels: Logging messages have severity levels (e.g. DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) that can be used to control which messages are output at different times. This allows you to focus on specific types of messages depending on what you're trying to do, and to filter out irrelevant messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Compatibility with libraries: Many libraries use logging to output messages, so using print() to output your own messages can make it harder to distinguish your messages from the library messages. By using logging, you can integrate your own messages more seamlessly with library messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Performance: print() statements can slow down your code, especially if you're outputting a lot of messages. The logging module is designed to be more efficient and less of a performance overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Maintenance: If you use print() statements throughout your code and later decide you want to change the way messages are output or filtered, you'll need to manually update all the print() statements. If you use logging, you can make the changes in one place (the logging configuration) and have them automatically apply to all logging messages."

    "## 9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-The Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons are debugging tools available in Python debuggers, such as the built-in pdb module or integrated development environments (IDEs) like PyCharm. These buttons allow you to step through your code line by line and inspect variables and expressions at each step. Here are the differences between the three buttons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Step Over: When you click the Step Over button, the debugger executes the current line of code and then stops at the next line. If the current line contains a function call, the function is executed, but the debugger does not stop inside the function. This is useful for quickly stepping through code without getting bogged down in details.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Step In: When you click the Step In button, the debugger moves into the next function call on the current line and stops at the first line of the function. If the current line does not contain a function call, Step In acts like Step Over. This is useful for examining the details of a specific function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Step Out: When you click the Step Out button, the debugger executes the current function call and stops at the next line after the function call. This is useful for quickly returning to the higher-level context after examining the details of a specific function call."

    "\n",
    "1.The program reaches the end of its execution and terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.A breakpoint is encountered. If a breakpoint is set in the code, the debugger will stop execution when it reaches that line of code.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:-A breakpoint is a point in your program's code where the debugger pauses execution, allowing you to inspect the program's state at that point. When you set a breakpoint, the debugger will stop execution when it reaches that line of code, giving you the opportunity to examine variables, inspect the call stack, and step through the code line by line."
