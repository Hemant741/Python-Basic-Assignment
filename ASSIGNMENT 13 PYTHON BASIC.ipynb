    "## 1. What advantages do Excel spreadsheets have over CSV spreadsheets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-Excel spreadsheets have several advantages over CSV spreadsheets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Formatting: Excel allows you to format your data by changing the font, cell color, borders, and other visual elements. This can make it easier to read and understand your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Formulas: Excel has a powerful set of formulas that allow you to perform calculations on your data, such as summing a column, finding the average of a set of numbers, or counting the number of cells that meet a certain criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Charts and graphs: Excel allows you to create charts and graphs based on your data, making it easier to visualize trends and patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Multiple sheets: Excel allows you to create multiple sheets within a single workbook, which can be useful for organizing and analyzing different sets of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Data validation: Excel allows you to set up data validation rules to ensure that your data is accurate and consistent. For example, you can require that a cell only contain a certain type of data (such as a date or a number), or that it falls within a certain range.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Macros: Excel allows you to create macros, which are automated scripts that can perform tasks such as formatting data or generating reports. This can save you time and reduce the risk of errors."

    " ## 2.What do you pass to csv.reader() and csv.writer() to create reader and writer objects?\n",
    " \n",
    " Ans:-To create a reader object, you pass a file object and optionally a dialect argument to the csv.reader() function. The file object should be opened in text mode and contain the CSV data you want to read. The dialect argument specifies the formatting options for the CSV data, such as the delimiter character, quoting rules, and so on. If you omit the dialect argument, the reader object will use the default CSV formatting options.\n",
    " \n",
    "Example:\n",
    " \n",

    "\n",
    "with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:\n",
    "\n",
    "    reader = csv.reader(file, delimiter=',')\n",

    "    for row in reader:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        print(row)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a writer object, you pass a file object and optionally a dialect argument to the csv.writer() function. The file object should be opened in text mode and represent the file you want to write the CSV data to. The dialect argument specifies the formatting options for the CSV data, such as the delimiter character, quoting rules, and so on. If you omit the dialect argument, the writer object will use the default CSV formatting options.\n",
